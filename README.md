## The Kalman Filter is a mathematical algorithm used for sensor fusion and estimation. It's a recursive solution for estimation problems that aims to predict the future state of a system based on past information. When used for sensor fusion, the Kalman Filter combines information from multiple sensors to provide a more accurate and reliable estimate of the system's state.
